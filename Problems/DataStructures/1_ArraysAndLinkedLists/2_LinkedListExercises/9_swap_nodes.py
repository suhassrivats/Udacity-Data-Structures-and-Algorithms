Problem Statement
Given a linked list, swap the two nodes present at position i and j. The
positions are based on 0-based indexing.

Note: You have to swap the nodes and not just the values.

Example:

linked_list = 3 4 5 2 6 1 9
positions = 3 4
output = 3 4 5 6 2 1 9
Explanation:

The node at position 3 has the value 2
The node at position 4 has the value 6
Swapping these nodes will result in a final order of nodes of 3 4 5 6 2 1 9
